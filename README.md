Description:

The Color Wheel Hangman works by having users trigger on key up commands to enter letters.  Words are randomly chosen from a preset array.  A function converts the letters to spaces every time a new key is pressed.  Users have a defined number of guesses until they win/lose.  Wins and losses are kept track of via a counter.
